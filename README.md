# Image Processing System with Python and NodeJS

This project aims to provide users with a server that allows them to apply image processing filters of their choice to their selected photos. The server is built using Node.js and incorporates Python scripts for image processing. The primary image processing filters used in this project are CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) and Auto White Balance.

## Installation

To set up the image processing server locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/AyseNurErdogan13/Image-Processing-System-with-Python-NodeJS.git
  
Copy code and run:
- node server.js
Access the server locally at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can perform the following steps to apply image processing filters to your photos:

- Select a photo: Click on the "Choose File" button to select a photo from your local storage.
- Choose the desired filter settings: Adjust the filter settings, including CLAHE and Auto White Balance parameters, to your preference.
- Apply the filters: Click on the "Apply Filters" button to process the selected photo with the chosen filter settings.
- View the processed image: The server will display the processed image with the applied filters on the web page.
